My sodium levels are so dangerously high that my doctor says I will certainly die within a year. But I don't care. I need the noodly goodness. I was fired from my job for spilling delicious, steaming, salty broth all over my paperwork, constantly. Now my son doesn't call anymore, all of my friends say I'm crazy, and my father is disappointed in me. Months ago, with tears in her eyes, my wife turned to me and said, 'Babe, its me or the soup.' I wanted to tell her that her ultimatum was insulting and that I didn't have a problem, but I couldn't speak through the sizable scoop of savory, tender chicken and silky, delicate noodles in my mouth.",

I’m having a plastic surgeon inflate me with hydrogen and raise my temperature to over 6000°C. From now on I want you guys to call me “Sol” and respect my right to give you vitamin D and probably sunburns. If you can’t accept me you’re a fusionphobe and need to check your astral privilege.
