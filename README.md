# Welcome to jCMD
jCMD is a Discord bot specialising in string processing and manipulation, written by reVerb#0001.
It is written in Node.js and is based on the Discord.js library: https://discord.js.org/.

# How to set up this bot
*I will assume that you are familiar with Node, the Linux command line, and how to edit a JSON file.*

  Do `npm install`.
  
  Rename the `config_template.json` to `config.json`, then modify the file's contents to the info you have. Add a folder named `data` and then make folders named `guilds` and `notes` inside `data`.
  
  To run the bot, simply do `node index`.
